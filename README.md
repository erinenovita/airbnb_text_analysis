# airbnb_text_analysis
This work is a completion of text analysis assignment in extracting insights from textual unstructured data (Public Airbnb data of Manchester, UK). 
First we explored the principles of text mining, BoW model, development of metrics that can be used to analyse structural elements of text 
(ie: readability &amp; keywords selection); we then delved deeper in generating polarity, sentiment and evaluation &amp; extraction of important topics.
